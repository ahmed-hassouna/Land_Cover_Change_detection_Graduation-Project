## 🧠 Research Overview

This research proposes a **comprehensive benchmarking framework** for evaluating deep learning models in **change detection (CD)** from aerial imagery. Change detection is a critical technology with applications in:

- 🏙️ **Urban Planning** - Monitoring urban growth and infrastructure development
- 🌍 **Environmental Monitoring** - Tracking deforestation, land use changes, and climate impact
- 🚨 **Disaster Response** - Assessing damage from natural disasters for rapid response
- 🛰️ **Remote Sensing** - Large-scale geospatial analysis and mapping

## 🎯 Key Contributions

### Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework

Our framework evaluates deep learning models across **three critical dimensions**:

1. **✅ Cross-Dataset Generalizability**
   - Assesses how well models transfer across different geographic regions, resolutions, and imaging conditions
   - Tests robustness when trained on one dataset and evaluated on another

2. **✅ Sensitivity to Change Size & Complexity**
   - Evaluates model performance on subtle vs. dramatic changes
   - Analyzes detection accuracy across varying spatial scales
   - Uses contour-based metrics to assess complex change patterns

3. **✅ Robustness to Noise & Image Corruption**
   - Tests model resilience against real-world image degradation
   - Simulates various noise profiles and corruption scenarios
   - Measures performance stability under adverse conditions

### Research Impact

📌 **For Researchers:** Enables informed model selection by revealing strengths and limitations of existing architectures

📌 **For Practitioners:** Guides the development of better models through systematic identification of failure modes

📌 **For System Designers:** Facilitates smarter ensemble strategies or custom model designs tailored to specific use cases

🧠 **Broader Applicability:** The methodology is adaptable to other domains requiring robustness and transferability, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and general AI systems
